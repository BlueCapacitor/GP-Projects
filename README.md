My GP Projects

These are the progects that I am working on in GP (General Purpose programing language).
I am an early adopter of GP and have worked closely with John Maloney, the author of GP.
More info about GP can be found at [gpblocks.org](https://gpblocks.org).

The 'main' branch contains version 1 of some of the projects, while the ongoing development is in corresponding branches.

To try any of the projects, you can [download](https://gpblocks.org/download) the GP application or
"Upload" and execute source files using a [browser-based GP interpreter](https://gpblocks.org/run/gp.html).
